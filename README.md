Developers often spend some of their time writing about tech online to share their insights and interact with the online community. They require a CMS-style blog site so that they can publish articles, blog posts, thoughts and opinions. 

Through this challenge, I learned that about using hooks and bcrypt to encrypt user password, using session to store user_info, using handlebars to generate views, and most importantly, the MVC separation of concerns.
